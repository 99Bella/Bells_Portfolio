# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This is a collection of projects I've worked on in the field of data science and machine learning. Each project is accompanied by a brief description and a link to the detailed code and documentation.

## Projects

### 1. Evaluating Neural Netwoorks for the Prediction of Formula 1 Race Results

- **Description:** In this project, we set out to harness the power of neural networks/deep learning such as RNN, LSTM and FFNN to predict Formula 1 race results based on the years 2018 to 2022. Additionally, we embarked on a unique investigation into the influence of the 2021 cost cap factor on race results during this period.
- **Code:** [F1 Results Prediction Models](https://github.com/99Bella/Bells_Portfolio/tree/main/F1%20Results%20Prediction%20Models)
- **Technologies Used:** Python, pandas, selenenium, bs4, scikit-learn, tensorflow, Google Colab Notebook

### 2. Salary Prediction Models 

- **Description:** Project employs a multi-faceted approach, logistic regression, neural networks, classification algorithms, and clustering techniques to predict job salaries and gain deeper insights into job market dynamics.
- **Code:** [Salary Prediction](https://github.com/99Bella/Bells_Portfolio/blob/main/Salary_Prediction.ipynb) 
- **Technologies Used:** Python, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn

### 3. ChrisCo Customer Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

- **Description:** An analysis in the form of visualizations was carried out on ChrisCo data on daily customer visits to website. Time series exploration and advanced visualizations such as heat maps and bubble plots are explored.
- **Code:** [Customer EDA](https://github.com/99Bella/Bells_Portfolio/blob/main/ik9201w_DV_Code.ipynb)
- **Technologies Used:** Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, holoviews, Jupyter Notebook
  
### 4. Predicting UK Car Accident Severity  

- **Description:** I built a machine learning models. In addition, data was cleaned and a Principal Component Analysis was carried out on the data before fitting models. 
- **Code:** [Predicting Accident Severity](https://github.com/99Bella/Bells_Portfolio/blob/main/Predicting_Accident_Severity.ipynb)
- **Technologies Used:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
